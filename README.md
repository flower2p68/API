# Learning Backend API Development & Security

This repository contains a backend API project created with the goal of learning and improving skills in backend development, with a special focus on **security best practices**.

## 🔧 What I'm Building

A simple API that simulates real-world backend functionality, such as:
- Authentication and authorization
- CRUD operations
- Input validation
- Error handling
- Secure data handling

## 🧠 Learning Objectives

- Understand how to build and structure a backend project
- Learn about secure API development practices
- Explore common vulnerabilities (e.g., SQL Injection, XSS, insecure headers) and how to prevent them
- Work with authentication (JWT, sessions, etc.)
- Implement logging and error monitoring

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Language: `Node.js` 
- Framework: `Express` 
- Database:  `MongoDB`
- Authentication: JWT (JSON Web Tokens)

## 🔒 Security Features (WIP)

- [x] Environment variables for sensitive data
- [x] Input validation
- [ ] Rate limiting
- [ ] CORS configuration
- [x] HTTPS support
- [x] Secure password hashing (e.g., bcrypt, Argon2)
- [ ] CSRF protection

## 🚧 Work in Progress

This project is actively evolving as I learn. Feedback and suggestions are welcome!
